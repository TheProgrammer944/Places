        <p class="FW"> this place can really brighten your day.<br> there are many fun outside roller coasters <br>and a VR playgrounds at FW (ferrari World). <br>And if you are lucky and you live somewhere near Yas Mall, <br>then you can go there when the time is perfect.<br> you wont even have to waste too much gas in your car.<br>But if you are even luckier and you are staying at     Radisan Blu hotel, <br> you can get there in just a     few minutes!<br> there is even a fun item shop where    you can buy merchandise<br> or save some things as a    suvenier. <br> this location is available in Abu Dhabi, Yas Mall.<br><br><br>This would be a <span class = "greenRatings">4.50 </span>out of 5 star rate  for me if I could go there every month.

<h2 id="JJ"> 2. Jabel Jais </h2>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/View_from_Jebel_Jais_-_panoramio.jpg" width="510">
        
<p class="JJD"> this cold mountain has a beatiful view at the top.<br> you can just drive up to Jabel Jais<br> instead of you trying to climb it.<br>
It has a beautiful view of many mountains<br> and buildings when you  near the top.<br> If you enjoy cold weather, then this one good places to be.<br> But because it is in one of the hottest countries, <br>It would be alot colder to go in winter because it is generely cold <br> in UAE winter. It would be much better to go in summer because <br>
when you reach near the middle, it will be like 4 to 8ËšC out there!<br> you can find this place in Ras Al Khaima and search on google maps <br> where Jabel Jais is<br><br><br>

I would rate this place <strong class="yellow"> 3.90 </strong>out of 5 <br>because it is always crouded<br> for puuting your tent and<br> because it pays 5 dirhams<br> just to see the view.<br>
Its just my opinion but its not yours

<h2 id="WWWP">3. Wild Wadi Water Park</h2>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Wild-wadi.jpg/440px-Wild-wadi.jpg">


<p class="WWWPD"> WOW! this is one of my favourite places in the UAE! <br>Its a water park. a wild waterpark.<br> Its called Wild Wadi Water park!<br> But unfortunetly because of the pandemic,<br> i dont really enjoy it much. In the pandemic,<br> I had to leave coughing because alot of the water <br> came in my mouth. It was horrible!<br>
If you could go to this place after the pandemic, <br>
you wouldnt mind coughing unless there was a new virus.<br> This place is availabe in Dubai, Jumeirah.
<br>
<br>I would rate this plce a <strong class="Red"> 2.0 </strong> out of 5 in the pandemic. after the pandemic, my rating would be <strong class="greenRatings"> 5.0 </strong> .
